# Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform  
**Tier 3 High Distinction Project** – Cybersecurity ⋅ Data Science ⋅ IT Operations  

A full-stack, role-based, multi-domain analytical dashboard built with **Streamlit**, **SQLite**, **OOP architecture**, and **GROK integration** that solves real operational bottlenecks for three distinct business units.

## Project Overview  
This application delivers **three complete, interactive dashboards** in a single Streamlit multi-page web app:

1. **Cybersecurity Incident Response Dashboard** – Identifies phishing surge trends and resolution bottlenecks  
2. **Data Science Governance Dashboard** – Analyzes dataset growth, dependencies, and recommends archiving policies  
3. **IT Operations Service Desk Dashboard** – Pinpoints staff/process delays in ticket resolution  

All mandatory features are implemented:
  
- Secure authentication (bcrypt + SQLite)  
- Full CRUD operations across all domains  
- Clean OOP refactoring (entity models + service classes)  
- Interactive Plotly visualizations for every domain  
- AI Assistant powered by OpenAI GPT (context-aware advice in all dashboards)  
- Proper separation of concerns (models / services / database / pages)
